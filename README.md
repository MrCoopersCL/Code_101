Class: Coding 101

Hello and Welcome to the Official Computer Lab Github repository for coding 101!
I am glad that you have decided to engage further with code. 
First things first, this repository is meant for students, parents, and faculty interested in the code we use in the class. 

In this repo you will find all the materials needed for the class. Feel free to familiarize yourself with python and GitHub! 

Once you pull the code you want to study, feel free to do with it as you please. Experiment with it, break it, and rebuild it. You may also set your own repository to public to showcase your creations! 

Some students have expressed interest in creating code outside of the classroom. I recommend just a normal installation of Python to get started. 
Here is the link to download Python on your own machine:
  https://www.python.org/downloads/ 
Please read the instructions carefully for your operating system and what requirments are needed. 

I will also review student code upon request and provide as much insight as I can. 
Code will also be reviewed for clarity from time to time. Changes to repo and edits to code will be logged below. 
Thank You for stopping by and happy coding!
  -Mr. Cooper
